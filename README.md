Windows users: The main branch contains a standalone executable for use on windows systems.
               Simple download and run.
               
               
Mac/Linux/Windows users: Mac / Linux standalones aren't current available, but you can use
                         the python version of the program. This requires that you have
                         Python 3.4 installed on your system, but it should be painlessly
                         multiplatform. Simply open the .py file and press F5 to run it from 
                         IDLE after you have Python installed.
                         

Program usage is fairly straightforward. Select your desired weapon type, target monster, and
desired buffs. The program will rank weapons of that type from most to least damaging.

An option is included to print the most damaging status weapons.

Not all weapons are included (all final weapons should be in, unless they're obviously weak)
and monster hitzone values are generous averages, assuming youmostly hit the monster in its
weakest zone. If this isn't practical, I averaged the defenses for the most optimal zones to 
target.
